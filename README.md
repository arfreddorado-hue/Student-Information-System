Here's a Python command-line tool for managing student data. Lets you add new entries, view existing records, make changes, remove entries when needed. Stores information in CSV files so you can save progress and reload later. Basic stuff but gets the job done for tracking details like names, IDs, whatever you need to keep organized.
